				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is Islamic Charity?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>lsamic charity is grounded in the Qur'anic verses (2:177):</p>
					<p>"It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces towards East or West; </p>
					<p>But it is righteousness-- To believe in God and the Last Day, </p>
					<p>And the Angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; </p>
					<p>To spend out of your substance, Out of love for Him, </p> 
					<p>For your kin, For orphans, For the needy, For the wayfarer,</P> 
					<p>For those who ask, And for the ransom of slaves; To be steadfast in prayer,</P> 
					<p>And practice regular charity; To fulfill the contracts Which you have made;</p>  
					<p>And to be firm and patient, In pain (or suffering) And adversity,</p> 
					<p>And throughout  All periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the God-conscious." </p><br><br>
					<p>Zakat-al-mal</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is zakat-al-mal?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					
						<p>Zakat  (i.e., Zakat-al-mal) must be  paid  by  all Muslims whose net worth for the preceding year has remained above a minimal exemption called nisab. Nisab has been estimated at $4,500.</p><br>

						<p>	Zakat  is 2 1/2% of the net worth held for  a  full lunar year (except that it is 5% of the "produce"  from irrigated  land  and 10% of that from unirrigated land, and 20% for minerals and treasures from the earth) while other items are excluded (e.g., a  home occupied  by  the owner--to the extent that it is not luxurious, including utensils, furniture, etc.; clothes; agricultural land farmed by the owner; jewelry to the degree that it is customary in your neighborhood). You may use our 
							<a href="http://www.iazf.org/ZAKAT%20CALCULATION%20FORM.pdf">zakat calculation form</a> to calculate your zakat-al-mal.</p><br>

						<p>Zakat may be paid at any time within the year (but to pay as soon after Ramadan as possible makes it easy for those who fast.) You know from  personal experience how the hungry feel and why we should give.</p>

			<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is zakat-al-fitr?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Zakat-al-fitr is a flat amount per household member paid by the head of the household for himself and his dependents. It has been estimated at about  $10 per person.  It should be paid to the bait-al-mal no later that the eid-al-fitr. </p>

			<li><a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is sadaqah?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Sadaqa is a  voluntary charity which may be made at any time. It can be of any amount "beyond your needs." It need not be money. Giving a smile to someone who needs it is also sadaqa.</p>
