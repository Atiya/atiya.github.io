      <h3> Welcome to my workspace.</h3>

<p>This space for whomever I have shared this link with. It is not a publicly known URL. I am sharing this with you to 
experience a design that will enhance your online presence. Your current site is a disservice to your organization due to the visual presentation, lack of clarity, the redundancy, and broken links. As a recognized charity a credible online presence will contribute to donations. You are a competing organization for donor dollars with every charity that has a presence online. Viewing a site like 
Islamic Relief leaves a credible impact. I pray Islamic American Zakat Foundation will chose to upgrade their site with this design, (or another) to create a professional presence. A site that is worthy of the donations it seeks and incites people to contribute to the good work the foundation does.</p>

<h3>Islamic American Zakat Foundation FAQ</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted a handsome <a href="https://iazf_faq.html">FAQ</a> sheet gleaned from the information on your website. A complete design which is visually consistent with this FAQ page can be created. Should you want to use this design please contact me at 202-422-2881 regarding implementation. This is copyrighted work and may not be copied. This is not a template.</p>



<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
