<p>This space for whomever I have shared this link with. It is not a publicly known URL. I am sharing this with you so you can experienc a design you may choose to use to enhance your online presence. YOur current site is a disservice to your organization. As a recognized charity a credible online presence will contribute to donations from people that are not familiar with your organization or your staff personally. The issues this design addresses is the visual presentation, lack of clarity, the redundancy, and the broken links.If you view a site like <a href="http://irusa.org/>Islamic Relief</a> in which you are a competing organization for donor dollars. There is a professional presence that is apparent online. I pray Islamic American Zakat Foundation will chose to upgrade their site with this design, (or another) to create a professional presence online worthy of the donations it seeks. </p>

<a id="IAZF FAQ" class="anchor" href="#IAZF FAQ" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Islamic American Zakat Foundation FAQ</h3>

<p>We’ve crafted a handsome FAQ sheet gleaned from the information on your website. A complete design which is visually consistent with this FAQ page can be created. Should you want to use this design please contact me at 202-422-2881 regarding implementation. This is copyrighted work and may not be copied. This is not a template.</p>



<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
