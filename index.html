      <h3> Enhance your online presence.</h3>

<p>This space for whomever I have shared this link with. It is not a publicly known URL. Below is a link that will take you to the 
<a href="https://atiya.github.io/IAZF/IAZF_FAQ.html">Islamic American Zakat FAQ sheet.</a> Weâ€™ve crafted a handsome FAQ sheet gleaned from the information on your current website.</p> 
<p>The visual presentation, lack of clarity, the redundancy, and broken links on your current site is a disservice to your organization. As a recognized charity, a credible online presence will contribute to donations. You are a competing organization for donor dollars with every charity that has a presence online. A complete design which is visually consistent with this FAQ page can be created.  Viewing a site like <a href="http://irusa.org">Islamic Relief</a> leaves a credible impact. I pray Islamic American Zakat Foundation will chose to upgrade their site with this design, (or another) to create a professional presence. A site that incites people to contribute to the good work the foundation does.</p>
